# Security Policy for BarberPro Web Application


## Overview
Security is of utmost importance in BarberPro to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure a safe and secure experience for both barbers and clients. This security policy outlines the measures taken and guidelines to implement security features using Spring Security.

## Application

1. Sign up
2. Login 
3. Password Security 
4. Spring Security 
5. Database security

## Data Protection

* **Encryption:**  Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit using strong encryption algorithms.
* **Data Masking:** Implement data masking techniques to obscure sensitive information in logs, databases, and user interfaces.

## Code Development Best Practices

1. **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.

2. **Output Encoding:** Encode all output to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

3. **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage and potential security vulnerabilities.

4. **Secure Configuration:** Avoid hard coding sensitive information such as passwords and API keys in the codebase.

5. **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies to ensure that known vulnerabilities are patched.


## Git Security Best Practices
1. **Access Controls:** Restrict access to the Git repository based on the principle of least privilege. Use access controls provided by Git hosting platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

2. **Code Reviews:** Implement a code review process to ensure that changes to the codebase are reviewed by multiple developers for security vulnerabilities and best practices.

3. **Branch Protection:** Protect important branches (e.g., master) to prevent unauthorized changes and enforce code reviews before merging.

4. **Secure Authentication:** Use strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., SSH keys, two-factor authentication) to secure access.

5. **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular audits of the Git repository to detect and mitigate security risks, such as exposed credentials or sensitive information.



## Implementation with Spring Security
1. **Dependency Setup:** Include Spring Security dependencies in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.

2. **Configuration:** Configure Spring Security by extending `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` and overriding `configure(HttpSecurity http)` method to define security rules and policies.

3. **Authentication:** Configure authentication mechanisms such as form-based login, OAuth, or JWT authentication.

4. **Authorization:** Define access control rules using method security annotations (`@PreAuthorize`, `@Secured`, `@RolesAllowed`) or configure it in `configure(HttpSecurity http)` method.

5. **Password Encryption:** Configure password encoding and storage using `PasswordEncoder`.

6. **Session Management:** Configure session management settings such as session fixation protection, session concurrency control, and session timeout.

7. **HTTPS Configuration:** Ensure that your application is configured to run over HTTPS by setting up SSL/TLS certificates.

8. **Input Validation:** Use validation frameworks like Hibernate Validator or Spring Validation to validate user inputs and sanitize them to prevent security vulnerabilities.
